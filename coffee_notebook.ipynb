    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The coffee, tea and mate trade of the UK from January to December 2014 was analysed in terms of which countries the UK mostly depends on for income (exports) and goods (imports). Over the period, the UK had a trade deficit of about 670 million US dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total trade in coffee amounts to about 1.2 billion dollars while total trade in tea is about 0.5 billion dollars. Mate represents about 0.1% of the total market and need not be considered further. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting to learn that the UK exports coffee and tea to more countries than those it imports from. This despite running a significant trade deficit overall. In value terms, Brazil is the largest exporter of coffee to the UK while Kenya exports the most tea.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is considerable import and export also between the UK and European countries in these products. France, Germany and Italy rank highly on both import and export lists while Ireland is the UK's most profitable export market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular trade is common with the UK exporting to 41 countries in every month of the year. The UK is heavily dependent on these regular customers who contribute close to 90% of the total export value."
